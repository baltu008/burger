# Burger App
1. To open this app, run server.js using ```nodemon server.js``` in terminal or gitbash.

2. Once server is listening on port 3007, then the user can navigate to the browser, where they will input ```localhost:3000```.

3. Handlebars will generate the main page where the user can view pre-set burgers, can add more at the bottom, and can eat them. Once eaten, the burgers will show up on the right side of the screen. No worries though, you can regurgitate them and eat them again if so desired. ;)
